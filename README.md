# Football Analytics Project

A simple football analytics project demonstrating **Python, SQL (SQLite), Excel, and Power BI**. This project processes football match data to calculate total goals per team and visualizes it in Power BI.

## Files

- `football_analysis.py` → Python script that reads `matches.csv`, creates an SQLite database, and exports team goals to Excel.
- `data/matches.csv` → Sample football match data.
- `football.db` → SQLite database created by Python.
- `team_goals.xlsx` → Excel file generated by Python, used in Power BI.
- `football_dashboard.pbix` → Power BI dashboard file.
- `dashboard_preview.PNG` → Screenshot of the Power BI dashboard.

## How to Run

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
3. Run the Python script:
python football_analysis.py
4. Open team_goals.xlsx in Power BI to explore the data and create charts.
